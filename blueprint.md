# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a static-first web application built with Astro.js. It is designed to be a website for a classic Asteroids 1979 game. The focus is on creating a fast, highly-performant, and scalable site that delivers minimal JavaScript by default, ensuring an exceptional user experience and top-tier Core Web Vitals.

## Project Outline

*   **Theme:** Retro 80s arcade aesthetic.
*   **Fonts:** "Press Start 2P" for headings and key elements, and a clean sans-serif for body text.
*   **Color Palette:** A dark, space-themed background with vibrant, glowing neon colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) for text, icons, and interactive elements.
*   **Layout:** Dynamic and engaging layouts with a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Background:** A subtle, seamless starfield texture over a dark background to evoke a sense of space.

### Features

*   **Home Page:** An impactful landing page with a strong retro feel and a clear call-to-action.
