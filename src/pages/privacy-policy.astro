    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
      service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
      knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and
      how it will be used.

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide
      you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect
      within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
      unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

      policies.
